            <p id = "background_info"> Hello, my name is Gabriel Fendt! Informally, I go by Gabe. I am an aspiring Java developer with an Associate Degree in IT from the Florida State College of Jacksonville.
                I was born in August 23, 1994 in Japan, I grew up for the early part of my childhood in Hawaii, and I've lived in Florida for most of my later life. </p>
                        </div>

            <h3> My Interests</h3>
            <p id = "interest_info"> I have many interests from music, video games, to travel. I like a lot of indie rock music, EDM, video game music, and ambient music. For video games, I grew up on Nintendo but 
                I've recently been getting into PC gaming. Some of my favorite video games growing up were Zelda, Pokemon, and Smash Bros. Recently, I've been enjoying  Among Us and Valorant, though I'm very
                casual and nowhere near an expert player. </p> 
            <p id = "interest_info2">I used to travel a lot of as a kid across the country been to around half the states in The United States. Some regions I haven't been to that I would like to travel to in the future (after the Covid 
                Pandemic is over!) include the Northwest states like Washington state, and I would like to travel to parts of Asia and Oceania like Japan (I was born in Japan but haven't really experienced it because I 
                left to Hawaii when I was very young), Taiwan, and Australia.
