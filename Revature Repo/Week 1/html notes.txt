HTML

HTML is broken down into two subsets: elements and attributes

	Elements such as <a> and attributes such as href

Two types of elements:
	
	Block elements such as <div>, will render on a new line by default

	Inline elements such as <span>, can sit next to each other on the
		same line

Common HTML Elements:

	<div> - block element defines division of the page, often contains other elements
	<span> - standard inline element
	<br> - line break (does not need closing tag)
	<img> - displays image (does not need closing tag)
	<p> - defines paragraph (block)
	<h1> through <h6> - header tags, h1 largest
	<a> - anchor tag used to make a hyperlink




<!DOCTYPE html> - doctype declaration to start an html file

<html> is the root tag of html documents, everything must be in between <html> and </html>

page is then divided between <head> and <body> tags

<head> has metadata, <body> has actual contents

HTML Tables:

Create a table, use <table> tag
<thead> defines header rows
	inside thead tag, can use <tr> to create rows
		inside those rows can use <th> for cell data
<tbody> defines the body of a table
	Inside tbody, also use tr tags for rows
		Inside those tr tags, use <td> for cells
<tfoot> can be used to add a footer element to table



HTML5 had some new elements, like semantic elements that describe parts of the file:

	<header>
	<article>

Also support for audio and video

	<audio>
	<video>

	
HTML Forms:

HTML has built in functionality for forms. Forms take various inputs and then submit to a server or handle with JS.

Input elements include

	Text field
	Password
	Radio buttons - one option from a list
	Checkboxes - multiple options from a list
	Select boxes - drop down list
	File select boxes - allows user to upload files from their machine
	Text area - multi-line text field
	Reset and submit buttons

Attributes used in forms:

	Action - how (or where) the form data will be processed.
	Target - where the result will open: same window (self) or new tab/window (blank)
	Name - each input needs a name value so the data can be labeled
	Method - what HTTP method the form will use to send the form, GET or POST
	Value - the initial value of the field
	Placeholder - hint to describe what should be entered in the field
	Required - field must be inputted with a value
	Min/Max - the minimum or maximum value the field can have
