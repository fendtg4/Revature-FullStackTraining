CSS - language for styling HTML documents
Specifies certain rules for layout and display of HTML elements
CSS uses key/value pairs to indicate the styling to apply

CSS uses selectors and declarations:

Selector: defines elements to be styled
Declaration: the style you are imposing on the selector

CSS Box Model

CSS treats each HTTML element as a box
Each box has 4 regions

From inner to outer:

Content
Padding
Border
Margin

Three ways to style CSS:

External Style sheet (a separate document)
Internal in the head
Inline in the actual element tag

Conflicts:

The CSS closest to the element will win-out in conflicts, inline wil override head which will
override external sheet


For padding:

Giving generic padding with numbers will shorthand the filling:

1 number: all four sides {padding:70px;}
2 numbers: first is top and bottom, second is left and right {padding:35px 70px}
3 numbers: 1st the top, 2nd is left and right, 3rd is bottom
4 numbers: 1st is top, 2nd is right, 3rd is bottom, 4th is left

Margin is similar to padding just on other side of the border

Display - determins the display behavior of the element, inline or block
Position: defines where on the page the element is displayed

	Static - element box is arranged normally
	

Bootstrap Grid system:

Bootstrap uses a layout called the grid system. Bootstrap consists of containers which contains rows, which
themselves contains columns. Layout will be responsive to window size changes.
